### My first commit
My first commit - Added fabric elements separately to make the elements like edit and cancel button images functional. But it should be grouped together so that when json loaded to the canvas then the elements should move together and also their functionality should properly working. 
Going to create a new file, in which every image element should have cancel image button on right upper corner and edit image button on right lower corner.

### My third commit

### My forth commit
